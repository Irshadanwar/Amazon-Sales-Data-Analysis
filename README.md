# Project Title: Amazon Sales Data Analysis
This is a part of my project in Physics Wallah

In this project, I will be using my skills in Excel and Python to dive deep into Amazon's sales data. My primary focus will be on data cleaning and formatting, ensuring that we have a solid foundation for analysis.

The next phase of the project will involve harnessing the power of Tableau to create visually compelling and informative data visualizations. These visuals will not only help us understand sales trends but also uncover insights that can drive strategic decisions. 


**Project Overview:**

In this project, I undertook a comprehensive analysis of Amazon sales data with the goal of extracting valuable insights to support data-driven decision-making within the business. The project consisted of several critical phases:

**1. Data Collection:**

   - The project initiated with the collection of Amazon sales data, encompassing details such as product sales, customer demographics, and order information.

**2. Data Cleaning (Excel):**

   - To ensure data quality and consistency, I employed Excel for data cleaning. This stage involved handling missing values, outlier detection, and data preprocessing.

**3. Data Imputation (Python):**

   - For dealing with missing data points, I utilized Python libraries to perform data imputation. Imputation techniques, such as mean, median, or predictive modeling, were applied to complete the dataset.

**4. Data Visualization (Tableau):**

   - Tableau was employed for data visualization, enabling the creation of various charts, graphs, and dashboards to visually represent the data's insights and relationships. This step enhanced the comprehensibility of the data.

**5. Analysis and Insights:**

   - The visualizations produced in Tableau served as the basis for a detailed analysis of Amazon sales data. This analysis addressed specific business questions, such as identifying top-selling products, high-revenue customer segments, and sales trends over time.

**6. Documentation:**

   - To provide a comprehensive project overview, I generated essential documents, including high-level documents, low-level design, and architectural designs. These documents outlined project goals, methodologies, data sources, data structures, data cleaning processes, imputation techniques, and visualization outcomes.

**7. Presentation:**

   - To effectively communicate project findings and insights, I created a presentation summarizing the project's objectives, methodologies, and key findings. This presentation aimed to make the project outcomes easily understandable for stakeholders and team members.

**Video Presentation - "First1.mp4":**

   - The "First1.mp4" video presentation was a dynamic component of the project, offering a visual and auditory explanation of the project's working. It covered data collection, cleaning, imputation, visualization, analysis, documentation, and presentation skills. The video enhanced the project's accessibility and provided an engaging way to understand the project.

**Conclusion:**

The Amazon Sales Data Analysis project followed a systematic approach, incorporating data cleaning, imputation, visualization, and analysis, with detailed documentation and presentations. The "First1.mp4" video presentation added an interactive dimension to the project, making it more engaging and informative. The project's insights are invaluable for data-driven decision-making, and the comprehensive documentation ensures that stakeholders and team members have a clear understanding of the project's significance and outcomes.
