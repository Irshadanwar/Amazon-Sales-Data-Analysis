# Amazon-Sales-Data-Analysis
This is a part of my project in Physics Wallah

In this project, I will be using my skills in Excel and Python to dive deep into Amazon's sales data. My primary focus will be on data cleaning and formatting, ensuring that we have a solid foundation for analysis.

The next phase of the project will involve harnessing the power of Tableau to create visually compelling and informative data visualizations. These visuals will not only help us understand sales trends but also uncover insights that can drive strategic decisions. 

**Project Title:** Amazon Sales Data Analysis

**Project Overview:**

In this project, I aimed to analyze Amazon sales data to derive meaningful insights and provide valuable information for decision-makers within the business. The project can be divided into several key phases:

**1. Data Collection:**
   - I initiated the project by collecting Amazon sales data. This data likely included information such as product sales, customer demographics, and order details.

**2. Data Cleaning (Excel):**
   - In the initial phase, I used Excel to clean and preprocess the raw data. Data cleaning involved handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and ensuring data consistency. This step is crucial as it lays the foundation for accurate analysis.

**3. Data Imputation (Python):**
   - After cleaning, I leveraged Python libraries to fill in missing data points. Imputation techniques such as mean, median, or predictive modeling may have been employed to replace or estimate missing values, ensuring a more complete dataset for analysis.

**4. Data Visualization (Tableau):**
   - Once the data was prepared and cleaned, I utilized Tableau for data visualization. This involved creating various charts, graphs, and dashboards to visualize the data in a more understandable and informative way. The goal here was to identify trends, patterns, and relationships within the dataset.

**5. Analysis and Insights:**
   - The visualizations created in Tableau were used for a detailed analysis of the Amazon sales data. This step involved exploring the data to answer specific business questions or uncover hidden opportunities. For example, I examined which products are the best sellers, which customer segments generate the most revenue, and how sales change over time.

**6. Documentation:**
   - Documentation is a crucial aspect of any project. In this case, I created a high-level document, a low-level design, and an architectural design. These documents outlined the project's goals, methodologies, data sources, and data structures. They also included descriptions of the data cleaning and imputation processes, as well as the Tableau visualizations and insights derived from the analysis.

**7. Presentation:**
   - Finally, I created a presentation to communicate the project's findings and insights to stakeholders or team members. This presentation summarized the project's objectives, methods, and key findings in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format.

**Conclusion:**
My project on Amazon sales data analysis demonstrates a structured approach to harnessing the power of data analytics for business insights. It combines data cleaning, imputation, visualization, analysis, and documentation to provide a comprehensive understanding of Amazon sales trends and patterns. This information can be invaluable for making data-driven business decisions and optimizing strategies for increased sales and profitability.
