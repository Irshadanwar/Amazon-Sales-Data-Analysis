# Amazon-Sales-Data-Analysis
This is a part of my project in Physics Wallah

In this project, I will be using my skills in Excel and Python to dive deep into Amazon's sales data. My primary focus will be on data cleaning and formatting, ensuring that we have a solid foundation for analysis.

The next phase of the project will involve harnessing the power of Tableau to create visually compelling and informative data visualizations. These visuals will not only help us understand sales trends but also uncover insights that can drive strategic decisions.
